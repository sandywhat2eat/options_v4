# Options V4 System - Fixes To Be Done

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes (June 30, 2025)

### 1. ‚úÖ Risk-Reward Scoring System (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Long options getting perfect scores (1.0) despite poor risk-reward
- **Fix**: Implemented realistic profit targets and confidence-based filtering
- **Impact**: Expected 80% reduction in long option recommendations

### 2. ‚úÖ Strike Selection Methodology (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: 90% of strategies ignoring IntelligentStrikeSelector
- **Fix**: Updated all 24 strategies to use centralized strike selection
- **Impact**: Consistent, intelligent strike selection across all strategies

### 3. ‚úÖ Volatility Surface Implementation (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: 20-40% mispricing in spreads due to flat IV assumption
- **Fix**: Implemented quadratic smile fitting with market calibration
- **Impact**: Accurate spread pricing, better strategy selection

### 4. ‚úÖ Bear Put Spread Probability
- **Issue**: 0% probability of profit calculations
- **Fix**: Corrected probability formula for debit spreads
- **Impact**: Bearish strategies now properly evaluated

### 5. ‚úÖ Bull Put Spread Construction
- **Issue**: "No net credit" failures in construction
- **Fix**: Improved strike selection and date filtering
- **Impact**: Credit spreads construct successfully

## ‚úÖ Additional Completed Fixes (June 30, 2025 - Latest)

### 6. ‚úÖ 'distance_pct' Error in Strike Scoring
- **Issue**: KeyError 'distance_pct' in _score_and_select_strike method
- **Root Cause**: Delta-based strike selection doesn't add distance_pct column in _get_candidate_strikes
- **Fix**: Modified _score_and_select_strike to calculate distance_pct if not present
- **Code Change**: Added check for column existence and safe calculation with target_price validation
- **Impact**: Eliminates "Error scoring strikes: 'distance_pct'" failures for delta-based strategies

### 7. ‚úÖ 'strategy_name' Variable Scoping
- **Issue**: Variable reference error in exception handler
- **Fix**: Fixed import path and improved error handling
- **Impact**: Cleaner error messages, no more scoping errors

### 8. ‚úÖ NoneType Comparison Errors
- **Issue**: Comparing None >= None in spread construction
- **Fix**: Added None checks before strike comparisons
- **Impact**: Prevents runtime errors in spread strategies

### 9. ‚úÖ Network Retry Logic
- **Issue**: errno 35 "Resource temporarily unavailable"
- **Fix**: Added exponential backoff retry (3 attempts)
- **Impact**: Better resilience to transient network errors

### 10. ‚úÖ Index Options Support (June 30, 2025)
- **Issue**: System only created strategies for stocks, not indexes
- **Root Cause**: DataManager only fetched FNO stocks from stock_data table
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `get_index_symbols()` method to fetch 5 main indexes
  - Modified `get_portfolio_symbols()` to include both stocks and indexes
  - Updated LotSizeManager with index name mapping (NIFTY 50 ‚Üí NIFTYBS)
  - Enhanced StockProfiler with `_get_index_profile()` for index-specific handling
- **Impact**: 
  - Now generates strategies for NIFTY 50, BANK NIFTY, etc.
  - Portfolio analysis includes 5 indexes (total 239 symbols)
  - Proper lot sizes: NIFTY=75, BANKNIFTY=35, FINNIFTY=65, MIDCPNIFTY=140

## üîÑ In Progress

### 1. üîÑ Strike Selection Improvements
- ~200 "Failed to find strike" errors remaining
- Need progressive constraint relaxation
- Better fallback logic for limited options chains

### 2. üîÑ System Validation
- Test volatility surface with live market data
- Verify improved strategy distribution
- Monitor probability calculation accuracy

## ‚è≥ Pending High Priority Fixes

## Known Issues to Monitor

1. **PCR Calculation**: Currently removed due to unreliability
2. **Calendar Spread**: Date filtering may need adjustment
3. **Diagonal Spread**: Complex construction logic needs testing
4. **Theta Decay**: Scoring may need calibration with real data

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run full portfolio analysis with new volatility surface
- [ ] Compare strategy distributions before/after fixes
- [ ] Validate probability calculations with market data
- [ ] Test edge cases (low liquidity, wide spreads)
- [ ] Monitor database insertion performance
- [ ] Verify lot size calculations

## Performance Metrics to Track

1. **Strategy Distribution**
   - Long options: Should drop from 144 to 20-30
   - Spreads: Should increase to 60-70% of portfolio
   - Neutral strategies: Should appear in low volatility

2. **Probability Accuracy**
   - Track predicted vs actual win rates
   - Monitor probability distribution
   - Validate confidence intervals

3. **Execution Quality**
   - Slippage tracking
   - Fill rates
   - Execution timing
