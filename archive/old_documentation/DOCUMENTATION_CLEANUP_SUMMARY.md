### 1. Created New Consolidated Documents

**README.md** - Main entry point with clear structure
- Quick links to all documentation
- Getting started guide
- Common tasks reference

**USER_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive user manual
- Merged content from TRADERS_GUIDE and TRADING_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY
- Added daily workflow with exact commands
- Included risk management and best practices
- Clear troubleshooting section

**TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md** - Complete technical documentation
- Merged architecture details from SYSTEM_OVERVIEW_V4
- Added code examples and patterns
- Included performance metrics
- Database schema reference

**CLAUDE.md** - Streamlined build/maintenance guide
- Removed duplicate content

**QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - New quick lookup guide

### 2. Archived Redundant Files

Moved to `archive_20250623/`:
- SYSTEM_OVERVIEW_V4.md (merged into TECHNICAL_REFERENCE)
- TRADING_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md (merged into USER_GUIDE)
- TRADERS_GUIDE.md (merged into USER_GUIDE)
- OPTIONS_V4_EXECUTION_INTEGRATION.md (duplicate content)
- DATABASE_SETUP.md (outdated)
- SUPABASE_DATA_VALIDATION_REPORT.md (one-time report)

### 3. Kept Specialized Documents

These remain as they serve specific purposes:
- **EXECUTION_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md** - Detailed execution procedures
- **DATABASE_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md** - Database technical reference
- **INDUSTRY_ALLOCATION_FRAMEWORK.md** - Allocation methodology
- **DHAN_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md** - API-specific guide
- **STRIKE_SELECTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Recent improvements documentation

## Benefits

1. **Reduced from 15 to 10 active documents** (33% reduction)
2. **Eliminated duplicate content** across files
3. **Clear hierarchy** - README → User Guide → Technical docs
4. **Role-based organization** - Users vs Developers vs Maintainers
5. **Easier navigation** with QUICK_REFERENCE.md
