# Gemini Portfolio Construction System - Complete Logic Documentation

## Overview

The Gemini Portfolio Construction System is a sophisticated quantitative portfolio management tool that constructs optimized model portfolios by filtering, scoring, and allocating stocks across sectors, industries, and market capitalizations. The system processes 400+ stocks and constructs focused portfolios of 40-50 positions based on risk-adjusted metrics and market conditions.

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Configuration & Market Environment Setup
The system initializes with configurable parameters based on market conditions:

**Investment Parameters:**
- **Total Investment**: ₹2,597,000 (configurable)
- **Market Condition**: "Stable" (affects allocation targets)
- **Data Source**: Dhan API (with yfinance fallback)

**Market Cap Allocation Targets (Stable Market):**
```
Large Cap:  40% (₹1,038,800)
Mid Cap:    35% (₹908,950)
Small Cap:  15% (₹389,550)
Micro Cap:  10% (₹259,700)
```

**Individual Stock Limits:**
```
Large Cap:  Max 7% per stock
Mid Cap:    Max 5% per stock
Small Cap:  Max 2.5% per stock
Micro Cap:  Max 1% per stock
```

### Phase 2: Stock Filtering & Qualification
The system applies multiple filters to identify eligible stocks:

**Risk/Return Thresholds (Stable Market):**
```sql
-- Minimum qualification criteria
total_return_3m >= 5.0%
expected_return_3m >= 5.0%
market_capitalization > ₹30 billion
beta_3m > 0.8
sharpe_ratio_3m > 0.5
```

**Example Filtering Results:**
```
Total stocks in database: 400+
After market cap filter: ~200 stocks
After beta filter: ~150 stocks
After return filters: ~100 stocks
Final qualified stocks: ~80 stocks
```

### Phase 3: Quantitative Scoring System
Each qualified stock receives a composite ranking score:

**Scoring Components:**
```
Ranking Score = (Normalized Composite Score × 30%) +
                (Sharpe Ratio × 15%) +
                (Sortino Ratio × 10%) +
                (3-Month Return × 25%) +
                (Momentum Score × 20%)

Momentum Score = (3M Return × 50%) + (1M Return × 30%) + (1W Return × 20%)
```

**Volatility Adjustment:**
```
Volatility Factor = 1 - (Stock Std Dev / Max Std Dev) × 0.5
Final Score = Ranking Score × (1 + Volatility Factor)
```

**Example Stock Scoring:**
```
RELIANCE:
- Composite Score: 0.85 (normalized) → 0.85 × 0.30 = 0.255
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.2 → 1.2 × 0.15 = 0.180
- Sortino Ratio: 1.5 → 1.5 × 0.10 = 0.150
- 3M Return: 12% → 0.12 × 0.25 = 0.030
- Momentum: 10% → 0.10 × 0.20 = 0.020
Base Score: 0.635
Volatility Factor: 1.2
Final Score: 0.635 × 1.2 = 0.762
```

### Phase 4: Sector-Industry Allocation
The system allocates capital based on predefined sector-industry targets:

**Sector Allocation Database Query:**
```sql
SELECT sector, industry, cap_size, percent_to_invest
FROM sectors_allocation
ORDER BY percent_to_invest DESC
```

**Example Sector Targets:**
```
Technology - Software: 8.5%
Banking - Private Banks: 7.2%
Energy - Oil Refining: 6.8%
Healthcare - Pharmaceuticals: 5.5%
Consumer - FMCG: 4.2%
```

**Allocation Process:**
1. **Match Stocks to Sectors**: Join stock_rankings with sector targets
2. **Sort by Score**: Rank stocks within each sector by ranking_score
3. **Apply Constraints**: Respect individual stock and market cap limits
4. **Allocate Capital**: Distribute sector allocation across top stocks

### Phase 5: Primary Portfolio Construction
The system constructs the initial portfolio by processing sectors in priority order:

**Example: Technology - Software Sector (8.5% target)**
```
Available Stocks: INFY, TCS, WIPRO, HCLTECH, TECHM
Ranking Scores: 
- INFY: 0.842 (Large Cap)
- TCS: 0.798 (Large Cap)  
- WIPRO: 0.756 (Large Cap)
- HCLTECH: 0.723 (Mid Cap)

Allocation Logic:
1. INFY: min(7%, 8.5%, 40% remaining) = 7.0%
2. TCS: min(7%, 1.5%, 33% remaining) = 1.5%
3. Remaining: 0% (sector fully allocated)

Result: 2 stocks, 8.5% total allocation
```

**Typical Primary Allocation Results:**
```
Sectors processed: 25-30
Stocks selected: 20-25
Total allocation: 60-65%
Remaining for misc: 35-40%
```

### Phase 6: Miscellaneous Stock Selection
Remaining allocation is distributed among unallocated high-scoring stocks:

**Misc Selection Logic:**
```python
# Exclude already selected stocks
misc_candidates = stocks NOT IN selected_stocks

# Sort by ranking score
misc_candidates.sort_by('ranking_score', descending=True)

# Allocate respecting market cap targets
for stock in misc_candidates:
    max_allocation = min(
        MAX_ALLOCATION_PER_STOCK[market_cap],
        remaining_cap_allocation[market_cap],
        remaining_total_allocation
    )
    if max_allocation > 0:
        allocate(stock, max_allocation)
```

**Example Misc Allocation:**
```
Remaining: 39.74%
Market Cap Distribution:
- Large Cap: 15.89% (40% × 39.74%)
- Mid Cap: 13.91% (35% × 39.74%)
- Small Cap: 5.96% (15% × 39.74%)
- Micro Cap: 3.97% (10% × 39.74%)

Top Misc Stocks:
1. HDFC: 7.0% (Large Cap, Score: 0.891)
2. ICICIBANK: 7.0% (Large Cap, Score: 0.878)
3. BAJFINANCE: 5.0% (Mid Cap, Score: 0.845)
```

### Phase 7: Price Fetching & Share Calculation
The system fetches latest prices and calculates exact shares to buy:

**Price Fetching Hierarchy:**
1. **Primary**: Dhan API (real-time)
2. **Fallback**: yfinance (delayed)
3. **Methods**: currentPrice → regularMarketPrice → recent history

**Share Calculation:**
```python
for stock in portfolio:
    investment_amount = TOTAL_INVESTMENT × (allocation / 100)
    shares_to_buy = int(investment_amount / latest_price)
    actual_investment = shares_to_buy × latest_price
```

**Example Share Calculation:**
```
RELIANCE:
- Allocation: 5.2% (₹135,044)
- Latest Price: ₹2,847.50
- Shares to Buy: 47 shares
- Actual Investment: ₹133,832.50
- Cash Leftover: ₹1,211.50
```

### Phase 8: Portfolio Validation & Metrics
The system validates allocations and calculates performance metrics:

**Validation Checks:**
```python
# Individual stock limits
for stock in portfolio:
    if stock.allocation > MAX_ALLOCATION_PER_STOCK[stock.market_cap]:
        raise Warning(f"Exceeds individual limit")

# Market cap limits  
for cap in market_caps:
    if total_allocation[cap] > TARGET_ALLOCATION[cap]:
        raise Warning(f"Exceeds market cap limit")
```

**Portfolio Metrics Calculation:**
```python
# Risk-Return Metrics
portfolio_return = Σ(stock_return × weight)
portfolio_risk = √(Σ((stock_risk × weight)²))
sharpe_ratio = (portfolio_return - risk_free_rate) / portfolio_risk

# Periodic Returns
for period in [1D, 1W, 1M, 3M]:
    portfolio_return[period] = Σ(stock_return[period] × weight)
```

### Example 3: Allocation Constraint Violations

**Current Issues Identified:**

**Market Cap Violations:**
```
Mid Cap: 37.35% vs 35% target (+2.35% violation)
Reason: High-scoring mid cap stocks in misc selection
Impact: Increased portfolio volatility
Solution: Implement stricter mid cap limits
```

**Sector Concentration:**
```
Unallocated Sectors: 15 sectors (60.17% of targets)
Reason: No qualifying stocks or insufficient FNO coverage
Impact: Reduced diversification
Solution: Expand stock universe or adjust targets
```

**Individual Stock Limits:**
```
All stocks within individual limits ✓
Largest position: INFY (7.0%) = Max allowed
Smallest position: CASH (1.0%)
Average position: 2.3%
```
